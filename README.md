# Pi(x)

## A number theoretical function allows striking visualization

The original prime visualization project repo'd [here](deadlink) follows a narrow train of thought. It was my expectation that adjacencies would arise in the process of formatting prime numbers to a hilbet curve presentation. In fact, this is ultimately unsurprising, given the existence of spokes on the Ulam spiral. Hilbert curves do, however, display a different flavor of density apart from the prime-rich polynomials that describe the Ulam spiral.

Narrow expectations and vision aside, there was yet still to explore. Many approximations exist for the nth prime, formulations related to the Zeta function exist, formulations leveraging clever techniques related to factorials are also acknowledged, albeit not discussed. 

## The formal approximation

![Eq1](https://math.vercel.app/?color=cyan&bgcolor=auto&from=%5Ctext%7BPi%7D%28x%29%5Csim%5Cfrac%7Bx%7D%7B%5Cln%28x%29%7D.svg)

is uneffably useful and impactful in its simplicity. This expression falls naturally out of an understanding that, within the exact formulation of Pi(x) (namely the one given in the below source) is a summation of Li(x^\mu)'s which is in fact asymptotic to x/ln(x). What we have above is several tiers departed from any rigorous process of derivation, and yet, is usually presented as a standalone awe-inspiring formula.

From a pedagogical standpoint, the clear and total force of the above asymptotic relation can really only be felt in the presence of:

Pi(x) =
